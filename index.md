Thank you for visiting my homepage.


I am a research fellow at the Center for [Civil Society Research](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/trans-sectoral-research/center-for-civil-society-research), which is located at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en). In the [WZB Protest Monitoring](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/trans-sectoral-research/center-for-civil-society-research/projects/politischer-protest-und-radikalisierung-protest-monitoring), a BMBF-financed research project on political radicalization and protest in Germany, I am responsible for the construction of a database on protest events in Germany.


I obtained my doctorate at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/), where I was also involved in the [ERC-POLCON project](https://www.eui.eu/projects/polcon). In my [PhD project](https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/67650), I engaged with the impact of populist radical right parties on party competition in Europe. Methodologically, I take a broad interest in quantitative methods, with a particular focus on text-as-data approaches.
