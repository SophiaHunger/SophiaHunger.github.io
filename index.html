Thank you for vising my homepage. 

I am a research fellow at the Center for Civil Society Research, which is located at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. In the WZB Protest Monitoring, a BMBF-financed research project on political radicalization and protest in Germany, I am responsible for the construction of a database on protest events in Germany. I obtained my doctorate at the European University Institute, where I was also involved in the ERC-POLCON project. In my PhD project I engaged with the impact of populist radical right parties on party competition in Europe. Methodologically, I take a broad interest in quantitative methods, with a particular focus on text-as-data approaches.
